# Intra-session stability

These configs specify the evaluation of intra-session stability in a contiguous block of 2D + click sessions.
Note due to simple oversight, these experiments lack the 7th day from WH's continuous block.
Each of 6 study days has 2 sets of open loop calibration separated by about an hour.
By training on the first set vs the second set, and evaluating on the second set, we can examine the stability of the learned map.

Each set has about 2 minutes of data. Hence, training is 50%, so 1 minute of data.
